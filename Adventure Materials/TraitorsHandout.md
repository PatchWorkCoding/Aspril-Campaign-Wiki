# The Traitors Handout
Greetings traitor! looks like you have 

## The hook
While you were out in the woods one day feeding off the mind of rat you saw deep inside its subconscious the image of a ruined church to Oghma the god of knowledge. As you searched deeper into to the rats feeble mind you saw a crypt underneath the ruins, and inside the crypt was multifaceted polished black gemstone that looks like broken obsidian. Even from the rats tiny sense you could feel the immense untapped psychic energy that the rock possessed. Just the thought of that kind of power fills you with an intense hunger to know more. You try to search deeper into the rats mind, but in your excitement and impatience you turn the rats mind into a slurry of neuro-synaptic paste and the information is lost to you. All you have is how to get the the ruins. 

Knowing that you can not brave the Emerald Wastes alone you will need to gather a group of adventures. What is the ad you put out to try and lure the necessary fools and scoundrel you will need to do this job?
