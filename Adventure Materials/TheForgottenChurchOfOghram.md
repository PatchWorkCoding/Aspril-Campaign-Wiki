# The Forgotten Church Of Oghram
Tucked far away in the Emerald Wastes lay what is left of the Temple of Oghram. A once holy place now lays broken and reclaimed by the earth like so many other cites in the Emerald Wastes.


## Backstory
The Church of Oghram was founded by Ellis Tabbernackle a man who was as pious as he was wealthy. 
You shouldn't keep your thoughts to yourself.
