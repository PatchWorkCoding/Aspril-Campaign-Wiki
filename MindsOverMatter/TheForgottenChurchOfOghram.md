# The Forgotten Church Of Oghram
Tucked far away in the Emerald Wastes lay what is left of the Temple of Oghram. A once holy place now lays broken and reclaimed by the earth like so many other cites in the Emerald Wastes.

## Lore
The Church of Oghram was founded by Ellis Greyjoy a man who was almost as wealthy as he was pious. He founded the church with a collections of members from the larger Oghram Church in the kingdom of Kaladrenor. They sought to bring science and reason to the Emerald Wastes. They wanted to categorize its grand majesty into tiny conceivable piece from which to build a larger understanding. For this purpose they built a church compound out of wooden planks transmuted into stone. The church was where they lived, worked, and communed with the divine, and for a time they were happy. But unfortunately for them the Emerald Wastes are hostile to more than just scientific inquiry. Mother nature seeks to snap you up at every turn and if you aren't constantly vigilant she'll catch you like a mouse in the talons of an eagle. That kind of pressure puts a lot of weight on the psyche, and if you aren't willing to trust other you will go mad. Just like Ellis.

Ellis Greyjoy was someone you might describe as a "harsh yet reasonable man". The kind of guy who yells at you not purely out of anger, but also out of love and passion for the subject matter. He has impossible standards for you because he wants you to be the best you can be. We can argue about the merits of his flavor of zealotry all day but there is one thing for certain it isn't conducive to a culture of honesty because people will be to afraid to speak up knowing they will disappoint. And that was exactly what happened. 

One day one a group of hunters came back from a scouting mission to find water for the tribe. Ellis' son who was one of the hunters  ended up coming back with a infected cut he didn't want to tell his father about for fear of disappointment. After a few days his conditioned worsened and eventually he was transformed into a fungal monstrosity. This monster killed 4 other members of the church before they were finally able to kill it.

Stricken with grief and unable to comprehend how he was complicit in the death of his son Ellis strove to create a more honesty and open community by creating a magically enhanced surveillance state through the use of psychic magic. His sermons slowly began to pervert Oghram's doctrines "of knowledge should not be with held" into a literal definition where no one should have the free will to lie. He sought to make hs people into one unified collective conjoined to the point where nobody could express themselves. No Lies, No Evil.

Eventually Ellis with the help of his followers constructed the "The Mind Supreme" an orb designed to grant immense psychic power to the wielder as well as give them Superior senses and grant them the ability to link minds and enslave other consciousnesses.

However when the followers performed the ritual Oghram realized what they were doing and intervened causing the ritual to fail and each of the four  priests involve in the ritual to be transformed into a hideous abomination. Hear All Evil, See All Evil, Speak All Evil, Know All Evil.

Each of these 

You shouldn't keep your thoughts to yourself.

Monster Ideas:
* Speak Only Evil - Gibbering Mouthers
* See Only Evil - Nothic
* Hear All Evil - Bat like monster with no eyes(Use orc War-chief Stats)

## The Wall (Entrance)
Around the church is a large mass roots and thorns that stand 10ft high.

The wall is an entity known as a "Town constrictor" or "Blight Nest" which is a creature that encompasses an area n a thick mass of thorned vines making it impossible for anything inside to escape, it then grows rapidly in the available space turning all the nutrients into more blights.

The Town Constrictor has 200hp, AC 10, and is vulnerable to Fire. every time the town constrictor takes damage it summons a Vine Blight, if it takes fire damage it summons a Needle Blight instead
