## Introduction
Before 

Did the stars cry when the god died? Did their sadness rip heavens apart? Did the moon howl with grief? Did the oceans boil with divine rage? We don't know, but we do know the earth swallowed the god whole just as she does all of us.

On a continent somewhere in the prime material plain is the resting place of a god. A being so huge their spinal colum composes the mountain ridge and their hand forms an archipelago. Their ribs scraps the heavens and legends say that nestled somewhere in their rib cages large expanse sits a fortress guarded by the most powerful beings in the prime material plane, and inside that fortress rests the God Heart, an object so powerful it can reform the very structure of reality by granting the user one wish.
