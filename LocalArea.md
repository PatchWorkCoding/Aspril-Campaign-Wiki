# The Town of Aspril
On the boarder of two different Kingdoms nestled in the center of the [Emerald Wastes](EmeraldWastes.md) lives Aspril also known as "The cross roads of everything" or  "The Light at the Edge of the World". All roads that move through the Emerald Wastes move through Aspril which makes it the an epicenter of trade for the region. People with grander ambitions have tried to found their own smaller cities in the emerald wastes, but in the end they are all reclaimed by the Emerald Wastes

being one part bar and one part church to the death god a lot of paranoid superstition surrounds The Pig Skull. Both the building and its owners have been marked as evil and unnatural by the people of Aspril.
