# Church of the Harvest God:

## Description 
On the very outskirts of Aspril where the roads turn from cobble to dirt and noise of the city softens into the burbling of a stream sits a long squat building built out of old wooden planks and nails. Above the door rests the mark of the harvest god constructed out of wooden planks roughly cut and nailed together, much like the church itself. There is no floor inside the church rather the ground has been cleared of all plant life until not but dirt remains. Donated chairs of all shapes and size line the line the walls all facing inwards toward the center of the room. The smell of mildew and dry dirt fill your nose.

## Philosophy 
The church and the community around it hold this principal to be the truth in its most absolute form: Through community we live, Through community we thrive. 
The church and everything in it is built by the community
When the church holds service it is more akin to the a book club. They read holy texts and discuss what it means to them and offer up new and interesting interpretation of the text. The hum of the many like honey bee swarms reminds all the members that they are part of the community and loved by the community. When the energy begins to die down one person in the community will stand up and read aloud the ending prayer and after that you may leave at your own speed. They also begin with a beginning prayer
