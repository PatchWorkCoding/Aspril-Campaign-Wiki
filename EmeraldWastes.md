# Emerald Wastes
The emerald wasts is then name given to the large pine forest that borders the kingdoms of *Placeholder 1* and *Placeholder 2*. The region is exceeding hostile to humanoid life with plenty of dangerous flora and fauna around to kill you. It is a forest of cautionary tails with tons of spooking things lying just beyond the tree line.

Because of the tall trees there are large sections of the region  that are perpetually covered in shadow.
