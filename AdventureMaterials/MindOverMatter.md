# Adventures of Aspril Issue #1: The Minds Over Matter

## The Hook
"Adventuring Help Wanted!" the ad reads. "Seeking adventures for escort to a forgotten temple in the Emerald Wastes. 25g per person upon arrival to our destination plus an additional 50g for help exploring the temple and another 25g upon on my return to Aspril." Doing some quick math you come to the conclusion that the final total is more money than you have ever had in a very long time.

## What to Expect
this is a game that takes heavy inspiration from the weird and wacky world of pulp fantasy so you can expect very little player death, and no irreversible player death. There will also be no exploration of explicit themes. If this were a movie I would rate it PG-13 (except for the swearing).

## Character Questions


## Character Creation
We'll do actual character creation in person, but for those who want to start thinking about it early here are the details:
* Your character starts at 3rd level
* All Character resource (i.e. Races, Classes, Subclasses, Background, etc) from the Core books (Players Handbook, Dungeon Masters Guide, and Monster Manual) are always permitted
* Character resource from first party books are almost always permitted but run them by me first before character creation
* Character resource from third party books aren't strictly prohibited but instead handled with caution. definitely run by me first
* Stats will be rolled using the standard rules in the Dungeon Masters Guide except after you roll your all 6 stats replace the lowest one with a 16
