# Emerald Wastes
The emerald wasts is then name given to the large pine forest that borders the [Kaladrenor Empire](../KaladrenorEmpire.md) and [Kragrock Dynasty](../KragrockDynasty.md). The region is primordial soup of evolution and strange magic. All the life forms in its midst are out to spread, grow, and multiple.
