# The Town of Aspril
On the boarder of between the [Kragrock Dynasty](../KragrockDynasty.md) and the [Empire of Kaladrenor](../KaladrenorEmpire.md) nestled in the center of the [Emerald Wastes](EmeraldWastes.md) lives the large community Aspril. 

## Culture
Also known as "The cross roads of everything" all roads that move through the [Emerald Wastes](EmeraldWastes.md) move through Aspril. Due to the [Emerald Wastes](EmeraldWastes.md) being the natural border between the [Kragrock Dynasty](../KragrockDynasty.md) and the [Empire of Kaladrenor](../KaladrenorEmpire.md) Aspril has the unique pleasure of being the epicenter of trade between the two kingdoms. Because of this the people of Aspril see themselves as very welcoming to outsiders. They encourage the idea that they are a "melting pot" of all the different culture that flow through its trade routes. 

Aspril has also been dubbed "The Light at the Edge of the World" because it is the only town that has survived the incredibly hostile conditions of the [Emerald Wastes](EmeraldWastes.md). It is through the people of Aspril constant Vigilance that the town stays alive and the trade routes stay open.
